  "A. Correct because the Cash conversion cycle (net operating cycle) (CCC) = Days of inventory on hand + Days of sales outstanding - Number of days of payables, and th\u00ed metrics indicates the amount of time that elapses from the point when a company invests in working capital until the point at which the company collects cash. A shorter cash coversion cycle indicates greater liquidity. A longer cash conversion cycle indicates lower liquidity. Also, Payables turnover = Purchases/ Average trade payables and Number of days of payables = Number of days in period / Payables turnover. Accordingly, the number of days payables for Year 2 = Number of days in period / Payables turnover, or 365 / 36 = 10.1389 and the number of days payables for Year 1 = Number of days in period / Payables turnover = 365 / 18 = 20.2778 (365 is used for the number of days in a year given the annual date). The CCC for Year 2 = DOH + DOS \u2013 Number of days of payalbes, or 11 + 24 \u2013 10.1389 = 24.8611 and the CCC for Year 1 = 14.7222.

  "B. Incorrect because it did not consider the Number of days of payables in the calculation of the CCC. The calculation CCC for Year 2 = Days of inventory on hand + Days of sales outstanding = 11 + 24 = 35, and CCC for Year 1 = Days of inventory on hand + Days of sales outstanding = 13 + 22 = 35. As the CCC calculated for Year 2 is the same as Year 1, the company's liquidity based on its CCC alone remained the same.",
  "C. Incorrect because it did not convert the Payables turnover ratio to Number of days of payables. Instead, CCC for Year 2 = Days of inventory on hand + Days of sales outstanding - Payables turnover = 11 + 24 - 36 = -1, and CCC for Year 1 = Days of inventory on hand + Days of sales outstanding - Payables turnover = 13 + 22 - 18 = 17.

  "A. Incorrect because it uses Net income instead of EBIT. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = (Net income + Lease payments) / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = (8 + 4) / (6 + 4) = 12 / 10 = 1.2.",
  "B. Incorrect because it sums Lease payments in the numerator. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = EBIT / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = 16 / (6 + 4) = 16 / 10 = 1.6.",
  "C. Correct because the fixed charge coverage ratio relates fixed financing charges, or obligations, to the cash flow generated by the company. It measures the number of times a company's earnings (before interest, taxes, and lease payments) can cover the company's interest and lease payments. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBIT + Lease payments) / (Interest payments + Lease payments) = (16 + 4) / (6 + 4) = 20 / 10 = 2.0. For computing this ratio, an assumption sometimes made is that one-third of the lease payment amount represents interest on the lease obligation and that the rest is a repayment of principal on the obligation. For this variant of the fixed charge coverage ratio, the numerator is EBIT plus one-third of lease payments, and the denominator is interest payments plus one-third of lease payments. Accordingly, Fixed charge coverage ratio = (EBIT + (Lease payments / 3)) / (Interest payments + (Lease payments / 3)) = (16 + (4 / 3)) / (6 + (4 / 3)) = (16 + 1.33) / (6 + 1.33) \u2248 17.33 / 7.33 \u2248 2.36, which is also closest to 2.0.",
