As debt increases the WACC decreases and the comppoy's value mcreases.",

  "A. Incorrect because at this early stage, debt capital is typically not available or available only at a high cost. From the perspective of an early-stage issuer, debt may be an attractive way to reduce or avoid the dilution associated with equity issuance. However, with cash flows that are negative and unpredictable, a typical start-up would have difficulty making regular debt payments, or 'servicing the debt.' Even if debt is available, the cost, inflexibility, and risk associated with borrowing are often unattractive to a start-up. As a result, debt is a negligible component of capital structures of most start-up companies.",
  "B. Incorrect because as a company exits the growth stage and progresses through the growth stage, debt financing might become more accessible, but the company might want to use debt conservatively and continue relying primarily on equity financing. Both the availability and the terms",
  "of debt financing improve for the company during this stage. Many growth companies use debt conservatively in order to preserve operational and financial flexibility and minimize the risk of financial distress. Equity remains the predominant source of capital.",
  "C. Correct because at the mature stage, the company becomes able to support low-cost debt, often on an unsecured basis. From the company's perspective, debt financing is likely to be more attractive than higher-cost equity financing. Also, as companies mature, business risk typically declines, and their cash flows turn positive and become increasingly predictable, allowing for greater use of leverage on more attractive (less costly) financing terms. Debt then becomes a larger component of their capital structures.",

  "A. Correct because debt represents a cheaper financing source for companies and a lower risk for investors. Because the returns to lenders are capped and because the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, corporations with predictable cash flows may prefer to borrow money rather than sell an ownership stake to raise the capital they need to finance their investments. This is because issuing more equity dilutes upside return for existing equity owners given that residual value must be shared across more owners.",
  "B. Incorrect because from the issuer's perspective, bonds are riskier than stocks for the same reason bonds are safer than stocks for investors. Bonds increase risk to the corporation by increasing leverage.
