  "B. Incorrect because defined contribution pension plans are managed for individual investors, therefore the risk tolerance of each plan varies with the individual. Some individuals will be investing for growth and will therefore seek assets that have the potential for capital gains. Others, such as retirees, may need to draw an income from their assets and may therefore choose to invest more in fixed-income and dividend-paying shares. The investment needs of individuals will depend in part on their broader financial circumstances, such as their employment prospects and whether or not they own their own residence. They may also need to consider such issues as building up a cash reserve and the purchase of appropriate insurance policies before undertaking longer-term investments. The risk tolerance of an individual investor varies by individual.",

  "A. Correct because -05 is the smallest of the three correlations and the closer the correlation coefficient is to -1. the greater the reduction in portfolio risk. The correlation coefficient between two assets determines the effect on portfolio risk when the two assets are combined. You will find that portfolio risk is unaffected when the two assets are perfectly correlated (p\u2081\u2082 = +1). In other words, the portfolio's standard deviation is simply a weighted average of the standard deviations of the two assets and as such a portfolio's risk is unchanged with the addition of assets with the same nsk parameters. Portfoho nsk falls, however, when the two assets are not perfectly correlated (p\u2081\u2082) <+1) Sufficiently low values of the correlation coefficient can make the portfolio riskless under certain conditions.

  "A. Correct because in evaluating investments using only the mean (expected return) and variance (risk), we are implicitly making two important assumptions: 1) that the returns are normally distributed and can be fully characterized by their means and variances and 2) that markets are not only informationally efficient but that they are also operationally efficient. To the extent that these assumptions are violated, we need to consider additional investment characteristics. One of them is kurtosis. Kurtosis refers to fat tails or higher than normal probabilities for extreme returns and has the effect of increasing an asset's risk that is not captured in a mean- variance framework. This applies to asset returns as several market participants note that the probability and the magnitude of extreme events is underappreciated and was a primary contributing factor to the financial crisis of 2008.",
