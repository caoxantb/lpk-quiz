  "C. Correct because, when we make a decision in a hypothesis test, we run the risk of making either a Type I or a Type II error. These are mutually exclusive errors: If we mistakenly reject the null hypothesis, we can only be making a Type I error, if we mistakenly fail to reject the null, we can only be making a Type II error.",
