  "A. Incorrect because the least competitive market structure is monopoly. In pure monopoly markets, there are no other good substitutes for the given product or service. There is a single seller, which, if allowed to operate without constraint, exercises considerable power over pricing and output decisions.",
  "B. Incorrect because perfect competition is a reality-for example, in several commodities markets, where sellers and buyers have a strictly homogeneous product and no single producer is large enough to influence market prices. Product differentiation is not possible under perfect competition.",
  "C. Correct because monopolistic competition is also highly competitive; however, it is considered a form of imperfect competition. The competitive characteristic is a notably large number of firms, while the monopoly aspect is the result of product differentiation. That is, if the seller can convince consumers that its product is uniquely different from other, similar products, then the seller can exercise some degree of pricing power over the market.",

  "A. Incorrect because soft power has a positive effect on globalization. Soft power is a means of influencing another country's decisions without force or coercion. Soft power can be built over time through such actions as cultural programs, advertisement, travel grants, and university exchange. And globalization also has cultural and communicative features. Although it can be difficult to measure these features, such as the spread of information or culture, it has increased interactions between citizens of countries all over the world. Internet usage allows for the near-instantaneous spread of cultural information and context.",
  "B. Correct because globalization is marked by economic and financial cooperation, including the active trade of goods and services, capital flows, currency exchange, and cultural and information exchange. Actors participating in globalization are likely to reach beyond their national borders for access to new markets, talent, or learning. By contrast, anti-globalization or nationalism is the promotion of a country's own economic interests to the exclusion or detriment of the interests of other nations.",
  "C. Incorrect because standardization is the process of creating protocols for the production, sale, transport, or use of a product or service. Standardization occurs when relevant parties agree to follow these protocols together. It helps support expanded economic and financial activities across borders. And as globalization deepens, companies develop standards and processes to incorporate multiple cultures into their overall corporate culture.

  "A. Incorrect because if taxes are cut or government spending rises, the expansionary fiscal policy will lead to a rise in aggregate output. If this is accompanied by a reduction in money supply to offset the fiscal expansion, then interest rates will rise and have a negative effect on private sector demand. We have higher output and higher interest rates, and government spending will be a larger proportion of overall national income.",
  "B. Incorrect because, in the case of tight monetary policy and tight fiscal policy, interest rates rise (at least if the monetary impact on interest rates is larger) and reduce private demand. At the same time, higher taxes and falling government spending lead to a drop in aggregate demand from both public and private sectors.",

  "C. Incorrect because automatic stabilizers-such as income tax, VAT, and social benefits are important because as output and employment fall and reduce tax revenues, so net tax revenues also fall as unemployment benefits rise. This acts as a fiscal stimulus and serves to reduce the size of the multiplier, dampening the output response of whatever caused the fall in output in the first place.

An expansionary policy could take one or more of the following forms cuts in sales (indirect) taxes to lower prices which raises real incomes with the objective of raising consumer demand cuts in corporation (company) taxes to boost business profits, which may raise capital spending, and cuts in tax rates on personal savings to raise disposable income for those with savings, with the objective of raising consumer demand. However, an increase (not decrease) in spending is expansionary. Expansionary fiscal policy also includes new public spending on social goods and infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools, boosting personal incomes with the objective of raising aggregate demand. An increase in a budget surplus would be associated with contractionary fiscal policy. while a rise in a deficit is an expansionary fiscal policy.",

  "A. Correct because when policy rates are above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary when they are below the neutral rate, monetary policy is expansionary. The calculation of the neutral rate is as follows: Neutral rate Trend growth Inflation target. Therefore, if monetary policy is contractionary then the policy rate (1.5%) must be greater than the neutral rate. Hence the long- term inflation rate must be less than 1.0% in order for the policy rate to be greater than the neutral rate",
  "8. Incorrect because when policy rates are above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary when they are below the neutral rate, monetary policy is expansionary. The calculation of the neutral rate is as follows: Neutral rate = Trend growth + Inflation target. Therefore, if monetary policy is contractionary then the policy rate (1.5%) must be greater than the neutral rate. Hence the long- term inflation rate must be less than 1.0% in order for the policy rate to be greater than the neutral rate.",

  "A. Incorrect because TR > TVC but < TC. As such the firm will stay in the market in the short run and exit the market in the long run.",
  "B. Correct because when TR total revenue is enough to cover TVC (total variable costs) but not all of TFC total continue to produce in the short run but will be unable to maintain financial solvency in 1,000 which is greater than TVC of $700, but not enough to cover the firm's TFC of $400. Therefore the firm will exit the market the long run.",

  "A. Correct because an inflation-targeting framework normally has the following set of features - An independent and credible central bank.",
  "B. Incorrect because by explaining their views on the economy and by being transparent in decision making, the independent, inflation-targeting central banks seek to gain reputation and credibility, making it easier to influence inflation expectations and hence ultimately easier to meet the inflation target.",

  "A. Incorrect because when they [central banks] believe that economic activity is likely to lead to an increase in inflation, they might increase interest rates, thereby reducing liquidity. In these cases, market analysts describe such actions as contractionary.",
  "B. Incorrect because the neutral rate is that rate of interest that neither spurs on nor slows down the underlying economy. As such, when policy rates are above the neutral rate, monetary policy is contractionary, when they are below the neutral rate, monetarypolicy is expansionary",
  "C. Correct because when the economy is slowing and inflation and monetary trends are weakening, central banks may increase liquidity by cutting their target rate. In these circumstances, monetary policy is said to be expansionary.",

  "A. Correct because the opportunity to generate higher profits may motivate companies to globalize. The first way to generate profit is to increase sales. Companies may choose to engage in globalization in order to access new customers for their goods and services. Another way to increase profits is to reduce costs. Globalization allows companies to access lower tax-operating environments, reduce labor costs, or seek other supply chain efficiency gains",
  "B. Incorrect because globalization can contribute to income and wealth inequality, as well as differences in opportunity, within and between countries.",
  "C. Incorrect because companies operating in lower-cost countries often operate in the local standards of those countries. If standards on environmental protection, social benefits, or corporate governance are lower in one country compared to another and companies ultimately reduce their standards of production in that context, then globalization can create a drain on human, administrative, and environmental resources.",

  "A. Correct because the velocity of geopolitical risk is the pace at which it impacts an investor portfolio. For the sake of simplicity, we explore short-term or 'high velocity' impacts, medium-term, and long-term or 'low velocity' impacts []. In the short term, we may see volatility in the markets affecting entire industries or even the entire market. Exogenous or 'black swan' events tend to fit into this category, causing market volatility and investor flight to quality. A black swan risk is an event that is rare and difficult to predict but has an important impact. Investors with the appropriate time horizon and risk tolerance may make tactical changes to their investment choices as a result of these events. Long-term changes are unlikely to be necessary.",
  "B. Incorrect because this relates to a medium-term impact of geopolitical risk instead: Risks with a medium-term impact may begin to impair companies' processes, costs, and investment opportunities, resulting in lower valuations. These risks tend to be distributed towards specific sectors, meaning they will impact some companies much more than others.",
  "C. Incorrect because this relates to a low velocity impact of geopolitical risk instead: The velocity of geopolitical risk is the pace at which it impacts an investor portfolio. For the sake of simplicity, we explore short-term or 'high velocity' impacts, medium-term, and long-term or 'low velocity' impacts. And long-term risks may have important environmental, social, governance, and other impacts.
