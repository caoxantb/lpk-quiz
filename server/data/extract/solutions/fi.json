  "A. Incorrect because the yield to maturity converted to a quarterly basis should be expressed in annual terms just like the semiannual yield to maturity: for bonds maturing in more than one year, investors want an annualized and compounded yield-to-maturity. The formula for converting m periods to n periods per year is (1 + APRm /m)m = (1 + APRn /n)n. Thus, (1+0.08/2)\u00b2 = (1 + APR4/4)4 <=> APR4/4= 1.98% \u2260 APR4 .",
